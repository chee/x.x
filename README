requirements
------------

• an apple macintosh computer running the apple macintosh operating system
  [https://www.apple.com/mac/]
• macports [https://www.macports.org/install.php]

guide
-----

get the repo and run bootstrap

	git clone https://github.com/chee/x.x
	cd x.x
	./bootstrap.sh

this'll install nginx and dnsmasq and it'll print out some instructions.

• make sure to add 127.0.0.1 to your dns servers in the Network pane in
  sysprefs.
• pick a string of text over 3 letters long
  when you are generating the key:
  		 1. enter that string and press <return> three times
		 2. press <return> 16 times
		 3. enter that string and press <return> one last time
• when it's done you can open up the generated ca.pem in Keychain Access.app
  and trust it.
  to do that:
  	  1. import it as a System cert
	  2. find and double click it (by default it is called internet widgits pty
	     ltd)
	  3. open up the little 🔻 Triangle called Trust
	  4. set to Always Trust
	  5. close the window, saving your settings

now you can map domains to ports by running:

	 ./map.bash $name $port

example:

	./map.bash tycoon 1234
	open https://tycoon.x.x

                                ---------------

that's all.

...mm.. well one more thing. maybe like me you would like to <cp map.bash ~/.local/bin/map> to make it nicer to use

  map stories 6969
  open https://stories.x.x
